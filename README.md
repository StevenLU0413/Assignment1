I succefully can read in the data and create list for different numbers of planets depending on the list, and for each planet their color will be randomly assigned during rendering. I think I did every correctly. EXCEPT for each planet to simulate it's gravity. I am so confused about what to do as far as the problem whats me to simulate:(. So I just plug in the numbers and used the formula provided in the question and see how it turns out. and my planet moves :) but in very incorrect patterns.
